# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in JavaScript related to handling null values when checking array lengths.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version that explicitly handles null values before accessing the `length` property.

This issue highlights the importance of defensive programming in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior and runtime errors caused by loose typing.
